I want my impact on the world who utilized technology to enhance the fitness and wellness of people nationwide. Fitness is a core part of who I am. My journey into fitness and has revealed me to how much control people have over how they feel and look everyday. People are quick to dismiss their potential due to misinformation and overall lack thereof of basic human functions. I want to use technology to bridge the gap and give people control over this portion of their lives. Using technology to make tracking calories and macronutrients mindlessly easy through the use of Visual Recognition and portable scales. Injuries and stop chronic pains in middle aged populations are often the result of muscular imbalances and tight muscles in regions other than the afflicted region. These pains go untreated due a general lack of knowledge of how muscles interact with each other. I want to prevent this by aggregating information from top tier physical therapists and movement specialists and integrating that with biomedical sensors to identify these issues automatically and bring this knowledge to the user. Ultimately I want my impact on the world to be a person who gave people control over fitness and the physical well-being and thus improved the general quality life of people.
